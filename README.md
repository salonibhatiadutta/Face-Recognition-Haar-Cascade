# Face-Recognition-Haar-Cascade
I'm creating this repository to explain the usage and efficiency of Haar Cascade for face recognition in video file and to count number of faces in a frame.
The Haar cascade frontal face xml file is used which consists of features values of faces built from positive and negative images.
The number of faces present in a frame is calculated and depicted on the top right most corner of frame.
Sometimes the faces are not recognize as they are small or blurred and the features or values are not present in xml file.
